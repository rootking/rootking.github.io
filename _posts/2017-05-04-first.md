# hello world

I'm currently deciding what to study this summer. 

**Moocs under consideration:**
* (Andrew Ng's course)[https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning]
* (Intro to machine learning course from udacity)[https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120]
* (Deep Learning by Google -- offered through udacity)[https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730]
* (Learning From Data)[https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html]


**Books under consideration:**
* (The Elements of Statistical Learning)[https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/]
* (Concrete Mathematics)[http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/gkp.html]
* (Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach)[http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/]
* (Deep Learning)[http://www.deeplearningbook.org/]

Because this is my first "free" summer in a long time, I'll probably focus on the moocs and supplement the course material with the books.
